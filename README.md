# A-star-algorithm
Requirements: 
  1. Python 
  2. matplotlib https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html
  
This program takes nodes as input which are in Cartesian coordinate system, edges with weight and start & goal nodes. The heuristic function calculates the euclidean distance between current node and goal node.

Output displays the given nodes/vertices, edges, g(n) of encountered nodes, open list of nodes with their f(n), closed/visited list, path and cost of the solution.

A plot is also visualized with the path traced out on it.

Check input_output_example.txt file for any queries about input and output.
